**QueueCTL** is a command-line job queue system designed to manage background tasks with multiple workers, retries (using exponential backoff), and a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for permanently failed jobs.  

It is built as part of the **Backend Developer Assignment** and demonstrates reliable background processing, persistence, and fault tolerance using a simple CLI interface.
